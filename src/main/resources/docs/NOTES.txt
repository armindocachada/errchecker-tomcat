Tomcat Error Checking Notes

1. My understanding is that we only want the errors count during the startup. However any errors that happen during the server run are still logged
to the /tmp/errchecker-log.txt file. We detect the server start by using the string "Using CATALINA_BASE". This wasn't specified in the exercise
description, but I think it makes sense.
2. I haven't gone aboard with regular expressions and limited myself to the ones requested in the assignment. In real life there will be probably be
other scenarios happening in the logs, that might not necessarily follow the pattern ERROR and Exception.
3. I used the library pyinotify. Please install with pip3 install pyinotify. This library helps a lot in the work of detecting new files or modifications
to existing files
